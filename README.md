# A TIY webpage replicated using Middleman
This is a simple webpage from The Iron Page website that has been replicated using Middleman.

## About the code
- ERB templating has been used.
- A helper method **location** has been created in config.rb with the locations for the Academies of The Iron Yard. Then, this helper has been used together with the built in link_to helper to generate the locations unordered list.
